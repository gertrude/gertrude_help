Need to do some simple calculations? Gertrude can help with that.

## Basic maths

If you type any C-style expression into the channel gertrude is on, and end your question with `??` gertrude will
attempt to evaluate it for you. Alternatively, you can start your question with `gertrude, ` or `!calc` to achieve the same effect.

Gertrude can answer any basic arithmetic question, you can use "+", "-", "/", "\*" etc in any combination, and you
can separate your expression with parentheses to gain precise control.

You can even say something like `three divided by four??` and gertrude will try hard to understand you.

If you want more detail, look at the [Further Maths](/help/2012/08/09/further-maths) article.
