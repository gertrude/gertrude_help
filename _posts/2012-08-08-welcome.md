Gertrude is chrisb's bot. More specifically she's the channel bot in the #ant.org IRC channel. 

## A bit of history

Gertrude was conceived in 1996 as a custom Perl script running on dougal, a
modified set-top box at Online Media (part of Acorn Computers Ltd). In 1999 she
was ported to [infobot][]. Sometime in 2004 gertrude became a [mozbot][] with a
lot of custom extensions, then in 2007 Ant started a half-arsed port to
[RBot][], wrote 90% of the custom code, and promptly forgot all about her. In
2009 he almost finished the job: excitingly, for the first time gertrude's
brain now included the knowledge from all her previous incarnations, with a lot
of the cruft weeded out. Unfortunately Ant got distracted again and gertrude
was never deployed in this form. In 2012, gertrude was rewritten again, this
time in a milder port from RBot to [cinch][], and round about this time she
also gained an online help system.

Gertrude's original brief was to remember any facts spouted in-channel (like
    _wine is nice_, _bricks are heavy_) and regurgitate them at inopportune
moments. She still does this, although these days only when asked. Many
alternative approaches were tried in the Great Natural Language Bot-Wars of
1999 (arvyg, vixenlove, etc) but gertrude prevailed.

Gertrude's capabilities have grown over the years, and her main role these days
is doing currency conversions, stock price lookups, and simple maths.


Gertrude's help system is powered by [Jekyll][], a git based blogging engine written in Ruby.
